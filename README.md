## BINARY SEARCH GAME
# by rubynettes v0.1

This is a simple command line app written in ~~Ruby~~ JavaScript (Angular). It is trying to teach how your computer would get to guess any given number between 0 and 100 in less than 7 steps.
The algorithm it employs to reach that goal is called Binary Search, and because the computer is challenged to find your imagined number (without peaking!) within 7 steps, its a game! Haha, isn't this fun?
